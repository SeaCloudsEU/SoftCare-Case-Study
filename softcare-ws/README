### Web Services Application Configuration
There are four files that need to be edited in order to configure the services: 
###### 
1. web.xml
2. beans_ns.xml / beans.xml
3. ws.properties
4. hibernate.cfg.xml


In 'web.xml' file you define the endpoint configuration (WS-Security enabled / disabled). In order to do that you specify wich beans file to use.

###### 1. web.xml
>...  
><web-app>  
>    <context-param>  
>    <param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>  
>    <param-value>WEB-INF/__beans_ns.xml__</param-value>  
>    </context-param>  
>...  
></web-app>

###### 2. Endpoint configuration: beans_ns.xml / beans.xml

__beans_ns.xml__ is the file used for web services without security. It's the file where you define the services that are exposed via SOAP ([cxf framework](http://cxf.apache.org/)).

###### 3. Application properties: ws.properties

This is the file where the secutity properties of the communications with the database and also the data stored in the database are defined.

###### 4. hibernate.cfg.xml

Encrypted values in hibernate.cfg.xml (ws.properties: _encryptedHibernateCfg=true_):
Username and password used to connect to database are encrypted. The values needed to decrypt / encrypt these values are in class: DbConstants.

If _encryptedHibernateCfg_ (ws.properties) is false, then username and password have to be written in plain text.
